Q: What's Jibin’s motto in cybersecurity?
A: Trust no one. Validate everything. Even your toaster.

Q: What's one project Jibin would take to a hackathon again?
A: The Pith Detector. Because Jibin gets to the core of everything — literally.

Q: What’s Jibin like as a teammate?
A: Sharp with Python, patient with Git merge conflicts, and always the one who brings humor to 2 AM bug squashing.

Q: Does Jibin love Star Wars or Star Trek?
A: Neither. He prefers “Star Logs” — the logs you find in SIEM tools.

A: Building AI-powered threat detection systems at Microsoft Security Research. Bonus points if there's basketball at lunch.
