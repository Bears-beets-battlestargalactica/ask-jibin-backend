1. Automatic Pith Detection in Tree Cross-Sections
Used Swin Transformer, YOLOv9, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN to automatically locate the pith in forestry images. Enabled precise detection even in degraded or noisy tree core samples.

2. Membership Inference Attack Evaluation
Performed membership inference attacks on machine learning models. Evaluated the effectiveness of MemGuard across complex datasets and explored privacy vulnerabilities in AI.

3. Provenance-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS)
Designed and deployed an intrusion detection system at ORTSOC using whole-system provenance and graph neural networks. The system detects behavioral anomalies across system event graphs.

4. Dynamic Social Media Web App
Built a full MERN stack Twitter clone. Implemented user authentication, tweet timelines, media sharing, and a scalable MongoDB-based data model.

5. Depression Detection via Tweets
Applied NLP techniques on tweet data to detect early signs of depression. Preprocessed user data and trained machine learning models to classify psychological patterns.
